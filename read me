designing my own pokedex using the PokeAPI, first time using an API.

I have built my own pokedex with the first page being able to search for any pokemon, aswell as the page showing 15 random pokemon.
the second page, you can switch through 5 generations of pokemon and it will show all. the Burger icon lets you create your team, view all 6.

I am finished this for now but i might make it so the team you create is saved in a database using PHP/SQL.
